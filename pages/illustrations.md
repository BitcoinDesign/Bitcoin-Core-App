# Illustrations

While [icons]({{ '/icons/' | relative_url }}) are small symbols to communicate single concepts, illustrations are larger, be more expressive, and convey more complex ideas.

Below are the three illustrations used during the milestone 1 [first-use]({{ '/first-use/' | relative_url }}) process. They represent "network", "block clock", and "initial block download".
