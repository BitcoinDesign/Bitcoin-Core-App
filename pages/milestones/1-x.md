# Milestones 1.x

The big goal for milestone 2 is to reach a parity point with the existing QT-based application, so it can take its place. This requires a lot of foundational work in the codebase, and a lot of front-end development work.

We need to provide full-fledged wallet features for single-key wallets across the whole wallet lifecycle. The specifics are yet to be determined and will be tackled via smaller milestone releases.

Below is a visual map of how we can reach this parity point based on Milestone 1, split up into distinct milestones. White screens already exist in milestone 1. Each milestone adds a mostly self-contained set of features, with milestones building on each other. These are explained in more detail in the following pages. 

{% include picture.html
	image = "/assets/images/milestones/version-2-map.png"
	retina = "/assets/images/milestones/version-2-map@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/milestones/version-2-map-big.png"
	alt-text = "A visual map of which screens will be added in 1.x milestones"
	width = 800
	height = 384
%}

Note that these are primarily design-driven milestones. Development milestones may differ, and things may need to be adjusted along the way.

Planned milestones:

- 1.1 Polish
- [1.2 Navigation]({{ '/milestones/1-2-navigation/' | relative_url }})
- [1.3 Import]({{ '/milestones/1-3-import/' | relative_url }})
- [1.4 Create]({{ '/milestones/1-4-create/' | relative_url }})
- [1.5 Activity]({{ '/milestones/1-5-activity/' | relative_url }})
- [1.6 Receive]({{ '/milestones/1-6-receive/' | relative_url }})
- [1.7 Send]({{ '/milestones/1-7-send/' | relative_url }})
- [1.8 Other]({{ '/milestones/1-8-other/' | relative_url }})
