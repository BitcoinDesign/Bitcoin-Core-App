# Milestone 1.8: Other

**Status: Early design exploration**

_[Design milestone](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App/milestone/8), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ek8w3n3upbluw5UL2lGhRx/Bitcoin-Core-App-Design?type=design&node-id=7516%3A13174&mode=design&t=sZSBHpOLLJmoMf57-1)_

There are several features and screens that are not essential to wallet functionality, like the console and messages signing/verification. These can be tackled in this milestone after the more foundational features are completed.
