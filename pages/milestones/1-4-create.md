# Milestone 1.4: Wallet creation

**Status: Early design exploration**

_[Design milestone](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App/milestone/4), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ek8w3n3upbluw5UL2lGhRx/Bitcoin-Core-App-Design?type=design&node-id=7516%3A13170&mode=design&t=sZSBHpOLLJmoMf57-1)_

In this milestone, we add the wallet creation flow. This will only include single-key wallets, but the design and development process will consider and plan for more options in future milestones.
