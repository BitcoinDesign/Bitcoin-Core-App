# Milestone 1.5: Activity

**Status: Early design exploration**

_[Design milestone](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App/milestone/5), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ek8w3n3upbluw5UL2lGhRx/Bitcoin-Core-App-Design?type=design&node-id=7529%3A16730&mode=design&t=sZSBHpOLLJmoMf57-1)_

In previous milestones, we added wallet creation and import. Now we add display of transactions and balances.
