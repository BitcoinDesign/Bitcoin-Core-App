# Principles

Design principles, or design philosophies, are helpful when making decisions large and small.

## [Accessibility]({{ '/accessibility/' | relative_url }})

To allow as many people as possible to use the application, the design (and implementation) should be highly accessible. This can take on many dimensions:

- Sufficient visual contrast
- Voice over support
- Keyboard navigation
- Dynamic text size
- Simple, clear language
- Localization

Getting these right can allow people in non-optimal situations to still successfully navigate and interact with bitcoin.

## Responsive design

For broadest accessibility, the application should adapt seamlessly to platforms and operating systems. There are practical limits for technical reasons, as well as differences in UX patterns of different environments.

## Universal design

While a bitcoin wallet for children can be playful and creative, this application is meant to be visually neutral. Accessibility & ease of use are priority over creative visual expression, so decisions on visual styling should be based on function (not just technical, but also cognitive, etc). 

## Open design

Just like the application code, the design is intended to be collaborated on openly and collaboratively. Design tools are not as sophisticated as development tools, so git-style collaboration is not possible. But we can still work with the tools we have and find workarounds for the gaps.
