# Block clock

For the first version of the application, the block clock is the central part of the user experience. The application is focused on letting users easily run a node, and the block clock provides a simple visual to see the current status.

	retina = "/assets/images/block-clock@2x.png"
	big = "/assets/images/block-clock-big.png"
	alt-text = ""
	width = 800
	height = 622

Every element in the block clock has a function. They can be combined to communicate different application states.
