# Milestone 1: Block clock

The first somewhat official release of the application only includes a simple [onboarding]({{ '/first-use/' | relative_url }}) flow and the [block clock]({{ '/block-clock/' | relative_url }}). Goal is to make running a node simple and convenient on many different devices. This also allows for establishing a solid foundation for the project, so future development or more complex UI will be easier.
