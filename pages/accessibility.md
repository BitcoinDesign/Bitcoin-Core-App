# Accessibility

The application should be as usable by as many people as possible. For more, read the Wikipedia entry on [web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility).

A few things to consider:

- Visual highlight for focused state of UI elements
- Clear accessibility labels of UI elements
- Multi-sensory feedback on interactions
- Alternate interaction options
- Sufficient visual contrast
- Support dynamic text size
- Simple, clear language
- Keyboard navigation
- Voice over support
- Localization
