# Planned features

**This is a complete work-in-progress.**

With the initial launch of this new application, we try to maintain feature parity with the QT application. Some options may be removed intentionally, and many options will be found in different places in the application. while also making improvements and creating space for new features and future improvements. On this page you can find a list of features supported across both versions of the client.

The page is called "Planned features", since the new application is under heavy development. "Planned" can mean everything across the feature lifecycle, from early exploration of late development. As development continues, we may change the scope of this page.
