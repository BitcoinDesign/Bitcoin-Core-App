# Roadmap

The long-term goal for the application is to become a full-featured bitcoin wallet with broad support across operating systems and devices, and works for both casual use and specialized use cases.

## Internal versions

The [first version]({{ '/v1/' | relative_url }}) will be a simple node runner for desktop and mobile Android.

The big [version 2]({{ '/v2/' | relative_url }}) will work towards broader platform support and wallet features.
