# Design system

Most aspects of the design are standardized. UI components and screen layouts are primarily combinations of these basic elements.

##### Why design documentation?

Maintaining documents is usually not everyones favorite activity, but it has a lot of benefits.

- Design is a great planning tool, it allows everyone involved in a project to more intuitively discuss and understand what will be built. Design documentation helps keep this process public and open
- Makes it easier for new contributors to understand, discuss, and improve what was done in the past
- Archiving design decisions and rationale reduces repeat of discussions already settled
