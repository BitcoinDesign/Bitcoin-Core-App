# Introduction

These are work-in-progress design documents for the QML-based Bitcoin Core application that is currently in early development. The goal of this site is to document and make easily accessible various considerations and decisions that went into the design of the user interface and user experience.

## Why?

Maintaining documents is usually not everyones favorite activity, but it has a lot of benefits.

- Design is a great planning tool, it allows everyone involved in a project to more intuitively discuss and understand what will be built. Design documentation helps keep this process public and open
- Design documentation makes it easier for new contributors to understand, discuss, and improve what was done in the past
- Archiving design decisions and rationale reduces repeat of discussions already settled
