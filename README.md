# Bitcoin Core App design

This repo is for documenting the design process for the [Bitcoin Core App](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml). It's very early in the process, and we want to be public about the design process and hope it results in a better application in the end. The design docs are hosted via Github pages, and the content is in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App/tree/gh-pages).
